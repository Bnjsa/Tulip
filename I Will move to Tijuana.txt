I Will move to Tijuana

I don't know Tijuana 
I never exited of Morelos 
I never traveled in airplane
I've never started from scratch
  
This can be a reward
Or can be a punishment too
I can Will travel to other state 
I can Will know other people

I'm can't do it, 
I'm not ready, 
I don't know much things, 
I don't believe in my own mind too. 

I haven't Good ideas, 
I haven't Good expectations, 
I don't know whats going to happen, 
I don't know what or who Will come into my life...
